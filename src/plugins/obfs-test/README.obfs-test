obfs-test

SYNOPSIS

The obfs-test plugin is a proof of concept for supporting protocol
obfuscation for OpenVPN via a socket intercept plugin.

BUILD

You must specify --enable-plugin-obfs-test at configure time to
trigger building this plugin. It should function on POSIX-y platforms
and Windows.

USAGE

To invoke this plugin, load it via an appropriate plugin line in the
configuration file, and then specify 'proto indirect' rather than any
other protocol. Packets will then be passed via UDP, but they will
also undergo a very basic content transformation, and the bind port
will be altered (see obfs-test-munging.c for details).

CAVEATS

This has undergone basic functionality testing, but not any kind of
full-on stress test. Extended socket or I/O handling options are not
supported at all.
